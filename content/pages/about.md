Welcome! My name is John Skender. I'm a software engineer specializing in web technologies across the entire stack.I have two years professional experience designing and developing custom applications with a focus on great design, scalability, and analytics that drive results.

I'm also a proud husband, father, athlete and musician.

Currently my focus is harnessing the power of the ServiceNow platform to create engaging and effective experiences across ITSM, Customer Service and Employee Experience.

I have a swiss army knife of javascript frameworks to solve problems in any domain. I can write you an API in Node or build single page web apps in React or AngularJS. Does your app need to interface with multiple third party tools or services? That's my jam! Want help reducing hands on keyboards and automating your common services? Look no further!
